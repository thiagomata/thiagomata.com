This course is focused on presents how to build and search graph data structures needed to create software agents, an approach that is useful for solving many problems in AI.  It also shows how to \"break down\" larger problems into a number of more specific, manageable sub-problems. It reviews the study of logic and conceptualize the differences between propositional logic, first-order logic, fuzzy logic, and default logic.  After learning about statistical tools commonly used in AI and about the basic symbol system used to represent knowledge, it focuses on artificial neural network and machine learning, which are essential components of computational and statistical methods, and theoretical computer science.  The course concludes with a study of the Turing machine and a discussion of the questionable claims that human thinking is a symbol manipulation."
