I am a developer, and I love it. I already have worked with PHP, Java, Scala, Python, Javascript - you name it.

I started learning code developemnt thanks to my father. He is a developer years before they have that name. With ten years old, I already was creating my own games and animations, using Logo language.

I started to properly work with web development in 2002, which has been my central area since then. Into this area, I already work as Software Engineering, Frontend Developer, Database Administrator, Process Analyst, Developer Lead, Data Engineer and Chief Technology Officer. All these different views helped me to have a better understanding of the particular needs of each area and to be able to integrate them properly.

I like to use knowledge of Prototyping, UML, BPMN and SaaS Architecture to perform a proper analyst and definition work. To manage my team, I like to use Scrum to product management and task prioritization. Whenever possible, I seek to use Lean Startup, Lean Canvas, and Knowledge Validation to ensure that the features developed have the desired effect.
